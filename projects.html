                <p>This project aimed to detect and classify emotions in spoken German dialogue from a popular reality show on YouTube. Commissioned by the Content Intelligence Agency, the goal was to develop a pipeline capable of analyzing spontaneous, emotionally nuanced speech and providing interpretable emotional labels at the sentence level.</p>
                
                <p>The pipeline began with audio transcription and automatic translation from German to English where necessary. Using curated and cleaned datasets (GermanTrain, MELD, GoEmotions), emotional categories were standardized according to Ekmanâ€™s six core emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust). Classical models such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression were initially tested using TF-IDF, POS tags, named entities, and sentiment scores.</p>
                
                <p>For more robust performance, deep learning architectures like LSTM and RNN were implemented with regularization, class weighting, and early stopping to prevent overfitting. The highest accuracy was achieved using fine-tuned transformer models (BERT and RoBERTa), trained on multilingual corpora and augmented for data balance and generalization.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, the modelâ€™s decision-making process was evaluated using explainable AI methods, such as attention visualization and post-hoc interpretability techniques, ensuring transparency and client trust. The completed prototype was demonstrated to stakeholders, highlighting its ability to identify emotional tones in real-world media content, with potential applications in audience analysis, media monitoring, and conversational AI systems.</p>

                <p>The Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre (NPEC) is at the forefront of advancing plant research for sustainable agriculture. A key challenge in this field is automating root segmentation from images to enable accurate root detection and analysis. Additionally, robotics plays a critical role in ensuring precise plant inoculation. This project addresses these challenges by developing a robust plant segmentation approach, accurate root tip detection, and precise inoculation using the OT-2 robot prototype.</p>
                
                <p>To tackle the complexities of plant phenotyping, we leveraged computer vision techniques to separate Petri dishes from background interference and perform semantic segmentation on plant elements such as seeds, shoots, and roots. After dataset refinement and preprocessing, I built a machine learning model capable of predicting plant structure masks with high accuracy. This allowed for instance segmentation, enabling precise measurements like root length and root tip location, both critical for assessing plant growth and characteristics.</p>
                
                <p>On the robotics side, the project focused on automating the delivery of inoculants to the identified root tips. I developed a precision liquid handling robot controlled by a PID controller, ensuring accurate liquid dispensing. This robot was integrated with the computer vision pipeline, allowing it to precisely target and deliver liquid to designated areas on the Petri dish. This showcased the potential of combining vision-based analysis with robotic automation for precision-driven interventions in plant phenotyping experiments.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to the PID controller, I also implemented a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. By designing tailored reward functions and performing hyperparameter optimization, the RL-based system autonomously navigated to the correct root tips for liquid delivery. A comparative analysis between the PID controller and RL revealed that the PID system achieved superior accuracy (<1mm precision), while the RL model excelled in speed, albeit with slightly reduced accuracy.</p>

                <div class="separator"></div>

                <p>In this project, I collaborated with a small team to build an end-to-end predictive analytics solution aimed at reducing traffic accidents in Breda. We worked with two key datasets: driving behavior data from ANWB and historical accident data from SWOV. The driving data included metrics such as harsh braking, sharp cornering, speeding, acceleration, and G-force, while the accident data provided contextual information on incident location, time, and severity.</p>
                
                <p>Our first step involved extensive data preprocessingâ€”cleaning the data, handling outliers using z-scores and quantile transformation, and applying logarithmic transformations after confirming a log-normal distribution. We engineered features and tested several machine learning models including Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest Regression, as well as deep learning approaches like Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using TensorFlow. Model performance was evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics, and we selected the most reliable model for deployment based on a combination of accuracy and interpretability.</p>
                
                <p>We deployed the final model using Streamlit, integrating it with a PostgreSQL database for dynamic data access. The web app allows users to assess real-time and forecasted accident risks at a street level, with features for visualizing trends over the past 30 days and predicting risks for the next 7 days.</p>

                <p>In this project, I developed a predictive machine learning model aimed at optimizing football player positioning based on comprehensive player data. The objective was to assist football clubs in identifying the most suitable field position for each playerâ€”whether forward, midfielder, defender, or goalkeeperâ€”using data-driven insights rather than relying on subjective decision-making or trial-and-error approaches during matches.</p>
                
                <p>The dataset used combined a variety of features including numerical attributes (e.g., age, height, weight, goals, penalties, and free kicks) and categorical ones (e.g., birth country, loan status, historical positions). I performed extensive data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying normalization techniques to ensure the data was suitable for model training.</p>
                
                <p>I implemented and evaluated a range of machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, Regression Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest Classifiers. After iterative tuning and performance comparison, the Random Forest Classifier, optimized via Grid Search, achieved the highest accuracy of 88.5%. Model evaluation included confusion matrices and classification reports to assess precision, recall, and F1-score, which showed particularly high performance for goalkeepers and defenders, while some overlap remained between forwards and midfielders.</p>

                <p>In addition to the technical development, I explored ethical implications surrounding player data use in sports organizations like NAC. I analyzed the clubâ€™s responsibilities related to data privacy, fairness, and quality under GDPR, and made practical recommendations to enhance their ethical data practices. This included ensuring transparency, minimizing algorithmic bias, and maintaining data security without compromising operational focus.</p>

                <p>The project concluded with actionable insights for player acquisition. By identifying players who may be underutilized or mispositioned, clubs can make more strategic recruitment and development decisions. This model offers a robust and scalable solution to improve player performance, reduce misplacement risk, and bring predictive analytics into football strategy in a practical, measurable way.</p>

                <p>Across Africa, millions remain disconnected from the internet, limiting access to education, economic opportunities, and participation in todayâ€™s digital economy. This project aimed to uncover the link between mobile network coverageâ€”a key component of infrastructure (SDG 9)â€”and internet usage, which plays a critical role in fostering global partnerships and development (SDG 17).</p>
                
                <p>To address this challenge, I conducted a data-driven analysis using datasets on network coverage and internet adoption across multiple African nations. After performing correlation analysis, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes disparities, highlights regions most affected by poor infrastructure, and simulates the impact of increased coverage on internet penetration rates.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, I presented the results to peers and mentors, emphasizing the urgent need for inclusive digital policies and affordable connectivity solutions to bridge the digital divide. The insights serve as a call to action for governments and stakeholders to prioritize internet accessibility for sustainable development across the continent.</p>
