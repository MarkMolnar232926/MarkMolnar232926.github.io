                <p><strong>The Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre (NPEC)</strong> is at the forefront of advancing plant research for sustainable agriculture. A key challenge in this field is automating root segmentation from images to enable accurate root detection and analysis. Additionally, robotics plays a critical role in ensuring precise plant inoculation. This project addresses these challenges by developing a robust plant segmentation approach, accurate root tip detection, and precise inoculation using the OT-2 robot prototype.</p>
                
                <p>To tackle the complexities of plant phenotyping, we leveraged <strong>computer vision techniques</strong> to separate Petri dishes from background interference and perform semantic segmentation on plant elements such as seeds, shoots, and roots. After dataset refinement and preprocessing, I built a machine learning model capable of predicting plant structure masks with high accuracy. This allowed for <strong>instance segmentation</strong>, enabling precise measurements like root length and root tip location, both critical for assessing plant growth and characteristics.</p>
                
                <p>On the robotics side, the project focused on automating the delivery of inoculants to the identified root tips. I developed a precision liquid handling robot controlled by a <strong>PID controller</strong>, ensuring accurate liquid dispensing. This robot was integrated with the computer vision pipeline, allowing it to precisely target and deliver liquid to designated areas on the Petri dish. This showcased the potential of combining vision-based analysis with robotic automation for precision-driven interventions in plant phenotyping experiments.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to the PID controller, I also implemented a <strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL) model</strong>. By designing tailored reward functions and performing hyperparameter optimization, the RL-based system autonomously navigated to the correct root tips for liquid delivery. A comparative analysis between the PID controller and RL revealed that the PID system achieved superior accuracy (<1mm precision), while the RL model excelled in speed, albeit with slightly reduced accuracy.</p>

                <p>This project tackles the growing threat of wildfires in outdoor environments by developing an <strong>AI-driven Outdoor Fire Alarm System</strong>. While most traditional systems are focused on indoor fire detection, this approach leverages a <strong>deep learning model</strong> trained on a custom dataset (300 images/class) to recognize fire, smoke, and safe conditions in outdoor visuals.</p>
                
                <p>The model achieved a 76% accuracy, with competitive performance compared to human-level accuracy (90.48%). To ensure trust and transparency, explainable AI techniques like <strong>Grad-CAM</strong> and <strong>LIME</strong> were used to highlight how the model interprets its inputs.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond model performance, the system was evaluated for usability through a <strong>think-aloud study</strong>, resulting in improved navigation, clearer instructions, and more responsive feedback mechanisms. The end product is a scalable, AI-powered safety tool designed to <strong>reduce response time</strong> and improve <strong>situational awareness</strong> in fire-prone areas.</p>
                
                <p>Future developments include enhancing the model architecture, expanding the dataset, and deploying the system for real-world field testing.</p>
