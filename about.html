                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Márk Molnár, I am 20 years old, and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at Breda University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. My current GPA is 4/4.</p>
                <p>I have a deep passion for solving complex data challenges using machine learning and AI. I enjoy analyzing patterns, building predictive models, and uncovering insights that drive meaningful decisions. Through hands-on projects, I’ve strengthened my skills and enthusiasm for data science.</p>
                <p>Programming excites me because it provides clarity and logic, where every challenge has a solution. Seeing my efforts translate into real results is incredibly rewarding. I believe AI is shaping the future, and I’m eager to contribute to solving emerging challenges in this dynamic field.</p>
                <p>Beyond academics, I value a well-balanced lifestyle. Playing football, going for a run, or going to the gym keep me active and sharp, both mentally and physically.</p>
                <p>As a lifelong learner, I continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge—whether through personal projects, internships, or collaborations. I am persistent and strongly believe that hard work and dedication make anything possible.</p>

                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised in Hungary, spending my early years in a small village where I attended elementary school. Later, I pursued my high school education at Varga Katalin High School in Szolnok, specializing in IT and Mathematics. It was during this time that I was introduced to programming, robotics, and linear algebra, which sparked my interest in technology and data science.</p>
            <p>In 2023, I moved to the Netherlands to pursue my studies at Breda University of Applied Sciences. This was a significant step in my personal and professional growth, and living abroad has enriched my experiences, both academically and socially.</p>
            <p>Outside of tech, I am a huge football enthusiast (once dreamed of going pro, but let's just say my skills didn't keep up). I also love traveling, exploring new cultures, cities, and cuisines, and I have a deep interest in architecture and tourism.</p>
            <p>My journey has been filled with challenges and opportunities, and I am grateful for the support of my family, friends, and mentors who have helped me along the way. I am excited about the future and look forward to the adventures that lie ahead.</p>
